              <p>My former educational, professional, and personal experiences have
deeply influenced my research and creative interests. They have
instilled in me a unique passion for studying and exploring data
science. Below, I will explain how my past educational, professional,
and personal experiences have shaped my keen interest and enthusiasm for
the field of computer science and the specific area of data science.
Additionally, I will explain why, upon recognizing my passion for
databases, I made the firm decision to pursue a PhD. degree in Data
Science at XXX University.</p>
<p>Before attending university, I completed my education in a small city
in China, where the educational standards were relatively not that high.
Although I believed that learning should bring joy, I did not experience
this during my actual pursuit of education. In my hometown, asking
questions to teachers was not encouraged or supported, and the emphasis
was more on solitary study. I felt lost and uncertain about my future
and couldn't imagine a scenario where I could freely pursue my studies
based on my true interests. Later, when I entered university at Huazhong
University of Science and Technology, guided by my family, I chose the
major of Biomedical Engineering. It was during this time that I began to
truly engage with computers. Since high school, I had been fond of
reading literary works by authors like Wang Xiaobo, who was also a
computer enthusiast. I also enjoyed reading computer-related works like
"Hackers and Painters". Therefore, upon entering university, I
increasingly felt that I should pursue a major related to computer
science. Thus, halfway through my first semester of my freshman year, I
took the exam to switch majors and successfully transferred to the major
of Software Engineering, which is closely related to computer science.
However, my academic journey thereafter was not smooth. Due to my lack
of exposure to computer programming before university and the delay
caused by studying Biomedical Engineering for a semester before
switching majors, my foundation was not strong enough to meet the
rigorous demands of the software engineering major. This became apparent
in the second semester of my sophomore year, which included courses such
as data structures, object-oriented programming, assembly language,
embedded systems, and C programming, which were challenging for me due
to my limited prior experience in the field of computer science. Many
classmates in similar situations suggested that we should simply aim to
pass exams without truly mastering the knowledge. However, passing exams
alone does not ensure true comprehension. This period was one of the
most distressing times in my life. I was deeply passionate about the
major and was determined to excel in it, but reality did not align with
my aspirations. Therefore, after careful consideration, I decided to
take a few months off from school to thoroughly supplement my computer
knowledge during my break. This decision led to me spending an extra
year compared to my peers in undergraduate studies. Subsequently, this
decision proved beneficial as it allowed me to delve deeper into the
field of computer science and gave me the courage to face similar
challenges with greater resilience.</p>
<p>Now, let me specifically discuss the education I received during my
university years. In my opinion, the academic atmosphere during
university laid the foundation for my desire to truly develop in the
field of academic research. I have always had a natural inclination to
ask questions, which was finally fully embraced in the free atmosphere
of university. While studying many computer science courses, I
tirelessly asked numerous questions or raised doubts to my teachers and
professors. Sometimes it might be about the details of an algorithm
proof, or it could be a new question I proposed based on the teacher's
lecture, such as when the teacher used the Towers of Hanoi puzzle with
three pegs as an example of recursion, and I proposed the problem with
four pegs to discuss together. I then searched for relevant information
and discovered that this was a quite classic problem proposed by
J.S.Frame in 1941, but its proof had remained unsolved until Thierry
Bousch resolved it in 2014, which was a relatively recent breakthrough.
I was thrilled to find that paper and read it; the excitement cannot be
described in words. This is the joy of exploration. There are many such
examples, but in summary, I am someone sensitive to questions. I enjoy
raising questions, discussing them with others, and ultimately, I relish
the state of solving problems. I am also grateful to my university
teachers, who treated my questions with great tolerance. All of this has
greatly benefited me and further strengthened my courage and confidence
to continue researching in this field.</p>
<p>As for why I want to pursue research in computer science and focus on
the field of data science, it stems from my research on input method
editor. In order to improve the efficiency of Chinese and English input,
I personally designed, implemented, and optimized an input method editor
using C++. A core part of input method editor is the storage and
retrieval of dictionaries. Although I achieved fast speeds using SQLite,
my pursuit of database speed is endless. Therefore, I am eager to
continue pursuing a PhD. degree, hoping to be extensively involved in
data science research. I want to personally design and implement one or
more efficient and robust databases. In addition to input method
research, I have a strong interest in text and data. During my early
days of learning Python, I attempted to acquire publicly available data
and analyze public text. In the process, I realized that data access
speed is a crucial factor. However, my perspective was not as broad as
it is now. Now, with the opportunity to pursue a PhD, it is a dream come
true for me.</p>
<p>The above paragraphs outline some of my educational, professional,
and personal experiences. Next, I will explain the background conditions
that support my pursuit of a PhD. in computer science. Firstly, my
undergraduate major was software engineering, which provided me with a
foundation in various computer science courses, ensuring that I have
sufficient background to pursue a PhD. degree. Additionally, I possess
outstanding engineering capabilities. For example, I developed an
open-source input method software for the Windows platform using C++ and
the CMake build tool. I also developed a personal blog system based on
Spring using Java and Maven. I have extensive experience with
programming languages, with at least four years of experience with Java
and Python, and three years of experience with C/C++. I am also
experienced with various programming tools such as IDEA, VSCode, and
Neovim, and I have a habit of maintaining dotfiles, with a repository on
GitHub that has garnered some attention. Furthermore, I have years of
experience using both Windows and Linux operating systems. For Windows,
I have an uncommon familiarity, and for Linux, I primarily use Arch
Linux and have at least three years of experience. Additionally, I have
a habit of blogging, especially in the technical field. I have written
over 500 blogs on my two main blog sites which is built with Hexo. I
believe that blogging not only deepens my understanding of knowledge but
also provides reference materials for others facing similar problems.
Moreover, I have a habit of continuous reading of technical books in the
computer science field. I enjoy pondering and solving the problems
presented in these books, finding it a pleasant activity, much like the
way physicist Richard Feynman found thinking about physics problems
enjoyable. Therefore, there is no doubt about my perseverance in
researching problems. Finally, but equally important, I have a top 1%
skill in sports, which is table tennis. This ensures that I maintain
normal physical health and maintain a stable balance between work and
life.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to discuss my determination, motivation, and
expectations for pursuing a PhD. For me, having at least five years to
consistently and passionately research a field I truly love is an
incredibly fulfilling prospect. My eagerness to engage in research in
the field of computer science stems from a desire to discover innovative
solutions, as opposed to engaging in repetitive tasks common in
corporate settings such as backend Java development or routine frontend
work. Take, for example, the database direction I aspire to research. In
a corporate environment, developers typically utilize pre-packaged
frameworks or APIs without delving into the underlying technical
principles of the database they are using. This lack of encouragement
for technical exploration in favor of business focus is something I find
unacceptable. I fear that prolonged exposure to such an environment
would stifle my ability to think critically, and without critical
thinking, innovation cannot thrive. I firmly believe that the pursuit of
innovative breakthroughs in cutting-edge computer technologies and
mathematical concepts, such as my interest in utilizing progressive
software like Neovim or cutting-edge operating systems like Arch, is
essential.</p>
<p>In the realm of data science, I am particularly enthusiastic about
comprehensively understanding the design and implementation of databases
and then innovating upon that foundation. Personally designing and
implementing an efficient database would be an incredibly invigorating
achievement. Additionally, I am drawn to database research because I see
it as a solid foundation for my future endeavors. Databases are integral
components of many applications, and a robust understanding of them is
crucial for application development. Post-PhD, I envision establishing a
startup, and my entrepreneurial ideas, such as those in input methods or
knowledge-based question-and-answer websites, would heavily rely on
efficient database systems, and the high-performance computing. However,
my current undergraduate level of expertise does not suffice for
realizing these visions, hence my strong desire to further my education
through a PhD, enhancing both my research and engineering capabilities
to support my entrepreneurial ambitions.</p>
<p>To conclude, I firmly believe that XXX University can provide me with
a profound understanding of computer science, particularly in the data
science domain, thereby facilitating the realization of my research
goals. That’s why I am very eager to apply for this program.</p>

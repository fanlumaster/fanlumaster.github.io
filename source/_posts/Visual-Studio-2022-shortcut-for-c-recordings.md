After two days of using Visual Studio, my prejudice on it disappears, to some extend.

Then, I want to learn to use it more effectively. Emmm, that's it.

Just to record some of the shortcuts belonging to VS2022, I like it.

> Run current test.

```
Ctrl + R, T
```

> `Console.WriteLine()`.

Just press `cw`, then press `Tab` twice. I knew it must have been a convenient way to output the 'print' clause.

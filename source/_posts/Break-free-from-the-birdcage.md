Life is so hard. However, there is a premise here, that is, the absence of something called courage. or so called bravery.

Today, and yesterday, may be a valuable day to be memorized in the future, cause in this period during these two days, I confirmed two things, the first matter has been long-stading, and I pondered it for a long time, so what is it? There's nothing to hide, the key word is seclusion. Yeah, during my spare time, I am always considering the feasibility of this matter, and eventually, I reached a state where I could freely choose about this matter, that's to say, there are no obstacles in front of me anymore. Then, what about the other thing? Bad news, there is no another matter that I need to consider.

Recent times, I am always wondering why we must have to endure working such long hours? You may say the salary is considerable, isn't it? Different people will give a great diversity of response. For me, at least, I don't think money could buy my freedom, I also don't want to give an assessment on the salary, freedom is so valuable that will never be sold for money, no matter how much money it is. If the work is not so torturous, I think enduring it is still possible. While the reality doesn't always cooperate. So cruel.

When my keyboard/pen comes to this point/place, I found that, my current level of English is insufficient to express my thoughts and feelings.
